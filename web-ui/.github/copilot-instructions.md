This project is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript web UI for onboarding: create an organization and an admin user (with all permissions), then log in the admin user using cookies. The backend is a Go API with an IAM mock service and a Swagger schema. Prioritize clean, functional, and maintainable code.
